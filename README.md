# ShoppingCart
The Udemy Course that I followed throughout the HIT339 Unit to understand .NET  in a comprehensive manner along with Microsoft docs: https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-aspnet-core-21-course/learn/ 
Shopping Cart is a project using C# and ASP.NET Core MvC architecture.

This project was made using a variety of online resources available (StackOverflow, MS docs, ChatGPT(Debugging), and the Udemy Course I followed)

The project uses N-tier architecture and a Repository pattern. 

To set up the Project locally:
Go to ECommerce -> Appsettings.json:
  "DefaultConnection": "Server={Your Local Server Name};Database={Your Database Name};Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True"
